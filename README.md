## day 1 p1

check if each char is numeric from left to right; break once we find it.

To find the last one, reverse the char order in the line

## day 1 p2

Wholesale replacement is invalidated by `eightwothree`; the order in which we replace the string becomes critical, and wholesale replacement cannot account for that.

I considered some arrangement that took into account possible overlaps, e.g. `eight` must be replaced before `two`, but `one` makes the ordering irreconcilable. If `eight` is before `two`, then `one` must be before `eight`, however `two` must be replaced before `one`.

Try `re.search`; note that `re.match` only looks at *beginning of string*

```py
import re

inp = 'eightwothree'
p = re.compile('two')
r = p.match(inp)
r.span()[0] # 4
```

Obtaining the `start` allows us to replace the *first* and *last* occurring string digit
